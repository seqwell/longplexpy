This repository contains a single MultiQC plugin for parsing and visualization of lima output files generated by the seqWell LongPlex pipeline.
If the MultiQC `lima` module is still running when this plugin is installed, the `lima` module can be disabled at the command line with `--exclude lima`.

## Local Installation

First install the Python packaging and dependency management tool [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
You must have Python 3.11 or greater available on your system path, which could be managed by [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or another package manager. 
Finally, install the dependencies of the project with:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Testing Installation

After local installation, a test report can be generated with:
```
poetry run multiqc tests/data
```
